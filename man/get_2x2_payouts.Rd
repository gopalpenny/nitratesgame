\title{Get payouts for 2x2 games}
\usage{
get_2x2_payouts(tA, tB, Cs, Cd, pos = FALSE, rescale = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tA}{Player A type as 1, 2, 3, or 4}

\item{tB}{Player B type as 1, 2, 3, or 4}

\item{Cs}{Cost of upgrading septic system (positive)}

\item{Cd}{Cost of contamination of domestic well (positive)}

\item{pos}{If \code{TRUE}, all payouts are shifted by Cs + Cd (prior to any rescaling)}

\item{rescale}{If \code{TRUE}, payouts are rescaled (see details)}
}
\value{
The function returns a tibble containing the following columns:
\itemize{
\item A, B: player decision as either 1 (Upgrade) or 0 (Neglect)
\item tA, tB: Type of each player
\item Cs_i: Expected utility (i.e., cost) of upgrading septic system
\item Cd_i: Expected utility (i.e., cost) of contaminated domestic well
\item UA, UB: Expected utility of both costs
\item payouts: Payout structure for each cell for A, B
}
}
\description{
This function generates a 2x2 payout matrix for players A and B
given their player type, decision space (upgrade septic or not),
and associated costs.

If \code{rescale} is \code{TRUE}, payouts are rescaled from
\code{c(min(A+B)/2, max(A+B)/2)} to \code{c(0, 1)}.
}
\examples{
payouts_pos <- get_2x2_payouts(3, 3, Cs = 1, Cd = 2, T)
payouts_neg <- get_2x2_payouts(3, 3, Cs = 1, Cd = 2, F)

get_2x2_ggplot(payouts_pos, T)
