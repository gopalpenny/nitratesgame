\title{Get 2x2 game solutions}
\usage{
get_2x2_game_solutions(payouts, output = "solution")
}
\arguments{
\item{payouts}{List of payouts from get_2x2_payouts}

\item{output}{Either "solution", "NE", "FB", or "type". See Value section.}
}
\value{
The \code{output} variable determines the type of output. The options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"solution"}: a payout tibble is returned that contains additional columns NE and FB
columns containing the solution.
\item \code{"NE"}: the pure strategies where NE == 1 or 0.
\item \code{"FB"}: the pure strategies where FB == 1.
\item \code{"type"}: the type of game (e.g., "social dilemma" or "collective synergy").
}
}
\description{
Get 2x2 Nash equilibrium and first best
}
\details{
This function evaluates Nash stability by checking, for each combination of
pure strategies, if any player is incentivized to change their strategy. The set of
pure strategies can be stable (NE set to 1), neutral (NE set to 0), or unstable
(NE set to -1). The first two (0 and 1) represent Nash equilibria. The first best
solution is calculated as the set of pure strategies that product the highest net
payout among all players (i.e., the sum for all players). A value of 1 indicates
the set of pure strategies is a joint optimum, and 0 indicates it is not.
