\title{Get payouts for 2x2 games}
\usage{
get_2x2_payouts(tA, tB, Cs, Cd, pos = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tA}{Player A type as 1, 2, 3, or 4}

\item{tB}{Player B type as 1, 2, 3, or 4}

\item{Cs}{Cost of upgrading septic system (positive)}

\item{Cd}{Cost of contamination of domestic well (positive)}
}
\value{
The function returns a tibble containing the following columns:
\itemize{
\item A, B: player decision as either 1 (Upgrade) or 0 (Neglect)
\item tA, tB: Type of each player
\item Cs_i: Expected utility (i.e., cost) of upgrading septic system
\item Cd_i: Expected utility (i.e., cost) of contaminated domestic well
\item UA, UB: Expected utility of both costs
\item payouts: Payout structure for each cell for A, B
}
}
\description{
This function generates a 2x2 payout matrix for players A and B
given their player type, decision space (upgrade septic or not),
and associated costs.
