Description: The goal of nitratesgame is to provide a simple framework for analyzing a 
    game theoretic model of community groundwater contamination. It offers two main tools 
    for analysis: (i) A tool for generating payout structures and solutions for 2x2 games, 
    and (ii) A groundwater model for generating simple estimates of the probability of 
    contamination for a well that sits within a grid of households in a neighborhood.
